# Release Notes - v0.1.3

## 🚀 New Features

### Enhanced RouterHost with Anchor Navigation Support

This version introduces comprehensive anchor navigation support to the RouterHost:

- **Hash Anchor Support** - Links with hash fragments (e.g., `#section-id`) now work correctly for same-page navigation
- **Cross-Route Anchors** - Navigate to different routes with anchor targets (e.g., `/about#team`) and automatically scroll to the target element
- **Smart Scroll Behavior** - Automatic smooth scrolling to anchor elements after navigation
- **Scroll to Top** - Pages automatically scroll to top when navigating without hash anchors
- **Query Parameter Preservation** - URL query parameters are now preserved during navigation

### Improved Navigation Experience

- **Same-Page Anchors** - Hash-only links on the current page use native browser scrolling behavior for better performance
- **Smooth Scrolling** - Cross-route anchor navigation includes smooth scroll transitions to target elements

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **RouterHost Return Type** - Fixed the return type of RouterHost component for better TypeScript compatibility

## 📈 Improvements

- Enhanced URL handling to support full URLs including pathname, search params, and hash fragments
- Better separation of concerns between same-page and cross-route anchor navigation
- Improved user experience with automatic scroll management

## 📝 Summary

Version 0.1.3 brings full anchor navigation support to the RouterHost, enabling seamless navigation to specific sections both within the same page and across different routes. The enhanced scroll management ensures a polished user experience with automatic scrolling to target elements and intelligent handling of different navigation scenarios.
